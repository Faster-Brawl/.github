# Faster Brawl

Faster Brawl is an effort to **template** and **standardize** Super Smash Bros. Brawl modded builds. It will do this by providing functionality to Dolphin that will maximize emulation efficiency for Brawl and netplay, as well as an ASM/C++ framework repo that will provide some basic codes that maximize boot efficiency, frame rate maximization, and other changes to improve the overall quality of life of Brawl.
